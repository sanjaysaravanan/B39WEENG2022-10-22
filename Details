Callback

  callback function ---> a function which is used an arguement to another function to execute a set of statements

  async operations execution ( operation running in background )
    Eg: setTimout ( wait for sometime to execute ) , setInterval ( executes frequently after certain interval )
  
  Javascript is a single thread 
  
  async operations are put into a queue after the wait time/ or completion of action.
  then js grabs them from the queue for execution

  use & purpose of the callback

  callback advantages:
    1. Modularity / Reusability
    2. To keep track when to execute what statements as a callback in a asynchronous operation

    asynchronous operation always go for named callback function to keep track

  pain of callback

    Callback Hell: Callback Hell is essentially nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. Every callback depends/waits for the previous callback, thereby making a pyramid structure that affects the readability and maintainability of the code


Promise:

  Object to understand the completion(or failure) of an asynchronous event/operation

  State:

    pending --->  initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.

    fullfilled ---> meaning that the operation was completed successfully.

    rejected ---> meaning that the operation failed.

    methods:
      then ---> executed when the promise is fullfilled/resolved
      catch ---> executed when the promise is rejected/unfullfilled

  Go thorugh online about below,
  API ---> Application Programming Interface

    APIs are the communication between services( backend, front-end, payment, ... ) can be using JSON etc...

    State of an application using APIs ---> REST APIs --> representational state transfer

  use eval for infx expresiion valuation

next session:

Fetch & then

  Fetch -> Interface to make an api call
    then ---> response --> convert response to json -> promsie .then (json -> operation on json)
  
  CRUD --> 
    Read => Fetch
    Create => Fetch with Method POST
    Update => Fetch with Method PUT
    Delete => Fetch with Method DELETE
  Chaining:
  All
  try & catch
